## HTTP  

is the fundamental Internet protocol for fetching documents, stylesheets, scripts, images, videos,  
fonts, and other resources over the Web — and for sending data back to Web servers.  
It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes.
